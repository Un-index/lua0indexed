# zero indexed lua
5 minute implementation of a rather trivial "0 indexed" table abstraction in Lua (note: this does not really make it 0 indexed, it just makes it so you can work with tables like they are 0 indexed)

## Not to be used anywhere of course
this works, but it's a joke 
and will likely break when used with builtin methods i.e it is not tested
